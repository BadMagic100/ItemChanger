Things to change

Improve loading strategy so that modules can safely add other modules (and placements can do the same and so on)
incompatibility warning tag has some weird timing related edge cases (ie if I add something incompatible after load it doesn't get caught)

future improvements:
* Nullability annotations
* PolySharp configure included types explicitly per runtime
* docs
* find additional places for exception handling
