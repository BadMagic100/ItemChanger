Things to change

use :new() in type constraints throughout to enforce/encourage json-friendly construction
Audit fields -> properties and usage of required throughout
make taggableobject.tags private, it's unsafe
see if there is a good way to dejank single/multicost placements
consistent interface for replacable locations
save and load profiles from file/stream
Improve loading strategy so that modules can safely add other modules (and placements can do the same and so on)
lock down load state to be accessible only to profile
incompatibility warning tag has some weird timing related edge cases (ie if I add something incompatible after load it doesn't get caught)
remove all static singletons, they make testability a nightmare.
  Open question - how tf do we know the current scope at any given time without losing serializability

future improvements:
* Nullability annotations
* PolySharp configure included types explicitly per runtime
* docs
* find additional places for exception handling
