Things to change

use :new() in type constraints throughout to enforce/encourage json-friendly construction
Audit fields -> properties and usage of required throughout
Improve loading strategy so that modules can safely add other modules (and placements can do the same and so on)
incompatibility warning tag has some weird timing related edge cases (ie if I add something incompatible after load it doesn't get caught)
make sure Loaded setter is not public

future improvements:
* Nullability annotations
* PolySharp configure included types explicitly per runtime
* docs
* find additional places for exception handling
