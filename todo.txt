Things to change

Rename AbstractX to X and renamespace them to appropriate homes
Move Cost stuff to a namespace
Make ModuleCollection a real collection and hide the Modules field
Make Load and Unload protected in favor of LoadOnce and UnloadOnce
Hide Loaded from serialization
Need a way for default modules not dependent on being defined in the assembly with IC
Game-agnostic container implementation
use :new() in type constraints throughout to enforce/encourage json-friendly construction
Audit fields -> properties and usage of required throughout
docs
move public APIs out of the "Internal" namespace
see if there is a good way to dejank single/multicost placements
object parent -> taggableobject parent
does incompat warning need to warn about mutual incompat only, or should it always warn

Unity stuff - is a unity shim package needed? How to deal with unity refs from nuget package?

Serialization - Do we need to support reflectionless serialization (system.text.json)? How do we not make it a major pain for users?
