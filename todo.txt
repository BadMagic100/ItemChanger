Things to change

* make costs clonable
  * Check for tags/placements that hold costs that need to clone the cost
  * check all existing implementations of Clone to ensure they call base or check loadedness in another way

* Correctly implement clone for duallocation

future improvements:
* Nullability annotations
* PolySharp configure included types explicitly per runtime
* docs
* find additional places for exception handling
