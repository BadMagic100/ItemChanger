Things to change

Need a way for default modules not dependent on being defined in the assembly with IC
use :new() in type constraints throughout to enforce/encourage json-friendly construction
Audit fields -> properties and usage of required throughout
docs
move public APIs out of the "Internal" namespace
make taggableobject.tags private, it's unsafe
see if there is a good way to dejank single/multicost placements
revamp visitstate
separate enums to different files
allow callers to specify Finder sheets
almost all of start location logic is HK specific so let it be a game specific module
Bring back objectlocation (see https://github.com/BadMagic100/ItemChanger/commit/a21ef4f582a22cf72eff92ed3a5ea14ddae1a175)
save and load profiles from file/stream
PolySharp configure included types explicitly per runtime
Improve loading strategy so that modules can safely add other modules (and placements can do the same and so on)
lock down load state to be accessible only to profile
get OnBeginSceneTransition dependence out of dualplacement
  the difference is that the scene loaded event may be called multiple times per active scene. However not all games have discrete scenes
  so some plan is needed still.
incompatibility warning tag has some weird timing related edge cases (ie if I add something incompatible after load it doesn't get caught)
consistent interface for replacable locations
remove all static singletons, they make testability a nightmare.
  Open question - how tf do we know the current scope at any given time without losing serializability
find sane places for exception handling

Unity stuff - is a unity shim package needed? How to deal with unity refs from nuget package?
